# The AFL Programming Language

The AFL programming language (regardless of whether one interprets the abbreviation as "Abstract Functional Language", "Another Functional Language" or any other fancy or not-so-fancy name) is a statically 
and strongly typed, purely functional language, mostly inspired by Haskell, with some features showing resemeblences with those of OCaml and the C family.

I created it as the main project of the Programming Languages and Paradigms course, offered as part of the Computer Science Bachelors Degree Program of the University of Warsaw.

The main aspect of the languages phisosophy is its simplicity and high abstraction, as its primary purpose is to become a conveniet tool for research and testing new, nonstandard ideas and solutions in the fields 
of programming languges' semantics and type theories.
